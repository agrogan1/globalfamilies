    "text": "1 Project Summary\nGender inequality perpetuates harmful norms that justify violence against women and children and is associated with higher rates of family violence.\nWorldwide, parental physical abuse is a common form of family violence that children are exposed to at alarming rates. Parental engagement in physical abuse is linked to negative child outcomes including depression, anxiety, and aggression that may persist into adulthood. Globally, these continuing mental health and aggression problems may have high financial costs, with effects both on social service systems and developing economies.\nDespite the substantial scholarship on parent- and family-level predictors of parent-to-child physical violence, important questions remain about societal-level predictors of parental physical abuse and its associations with young children’s development in developing and transitional countries.\nA further gap in prior literature is the lack of studies that have examined potential moderators such as child age and household economic status in the associations between gender inequality and parental violence against children.\nUsing data from over 520,000 families in 57 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the current project seeks to address these research gaps by examining the associations of country-level gender inequality and violent social contexts with caregivers’ use of physically abusive behavior and child social-emotional development. We will employ multilevel models using data on parental physical violence against children, family socio-economic characteristics, and children’s social-emotional development from the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) and data on country-level gender inequality and violent social contexts from the United Nations Development Programme on Human Development and the World Health Organization Global Health Observatory.\nThe specific aims are to 1) examine the associations of gender inequality with parental child physical abuse in LMICs, and the moderating roles of child age and household economic status in these associations, 2) examine the associations of violent social norms and crimes with parental physical abuse in LMICs, and 3) examine the associations of parental physical abuse with child social-emotional development in the context of gender inequality and violent norms and crimes in LMICs, and whether country-level normativeness of physical abuse moderates these associations.\nThe proposed studies will advance the understanding of macro-level social and economic indicators that perpetuate caregivers’ physical violence against children in international contexts. Study findings will inform cross-cultural programs and policies that reduce gender disparities and prevent parental physical abuse to promote child social-emotional development across the globe.\nIn addition, these studies will provide rigorous research engagement opportunities to undergraduate students and graduate students and strengthen the research environment at the University of Michigan-Flint."

Her research builds on her experience in parent education programs that serve families in marginalized communities in Michigan. Much of her current research focuses on the risks of negative contextual and family influences such as neighborhood poverty and disorganization, and parental corporal punishment on behavior problems and maltreatment in early childhood.\nAndy Grogan-Kaylor, Co-Investigator\nSandra K. Danziger Collegiate Professor, Professor of Social Work\nProfessor Grogan-Kaylor’s research focuses on knowledge development and intervention research on children and families with the aim of reducing violence against children and improving family and child wellbeing. Grogan-Kaylor’s current research projects examine parenting behaviors such as physical punishment and parental expressions of emotional warmth and support, and their effects on children’s aggression, antisocial behavior, anxiety, and depression.\nShawna Lee, Co-Investigator\nProfessor of Social Work\nProfessor Lee is a professor at the University of Michigan School of Social Work. She is the director of the Parenting in Context Research Lab and the director of the Program Evaluation Group at the School. Lee has published on topics related to child maltreatment, fathers’ parenting, father-child relationships, parenting stress and family functioning, and parental discipline. Her recent research focuses on parenting and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic."

    "text": "3.1 Why Use R?\nR has a reputation for being difficult to learn, and a lot of that reputation is deserved. However, it is possible to teach R in an accessible way, and a little bit of R can take you a long way.\nR is open source, and therefore free, statistical software that is particularly good at obtaining, analyzing and visualizing data.\nR Commands are stored in a script or code file that usually ends in .R, e.g. myscript.R. The command file is distinct from your actual data, stored in an .RData file, e.g. mydata.RData.\nA great deal of data analysis and visualization involves the same core set of steps.\nGiven the fact that we often want to apply the same core set of tasks to new questions and new data, there are ways to overcome the steep learning curve and learn a replicable set of commands that can be applied to problem after problem. The same 5 to 10 lines of R code can often be tweaked over and over again for multiple projects.\n\\[\\text{have a question} \\rightarrow \\text{get data} \\rightarrow \\text{process and clean data} \\rightarrow\\] \\[\\text{visualize data} \\rightarrow \\text{analyze data} \\rightarrow \\text{make conclusions}\\]"

    "text": "A.3 Simulate Data Based on MICS\nThis is multilevel data where individuals are nested, or clustered, inside countries. Excellent technical and pedagogical discussions of multilevel models can be found in Raudenbush & Bryk (2002), Singer & Willett (2003), Rabe-Hesketh & Skrondal (2022), Luke (2004), and Kreft & de Leeuw (1998).\n\nA.3.1 Level 2\nSimulating the second level of the data is relatively easy. We simply need to provide the number of countries, and then generate random effects for each country. Random effects are discussed in the above references, but essentially represent country level differences in the data.\n\n\nShow the code\ncountry <- seq(1:N_countries) # sequence 1 to 30\n\nu0 <- rnorm(N_countries, 0, .25) # random intercept\n\nu1 <- rnorm(N_countries, 0, .05) # random slope\n\nrandomeffects <- data.frame(country, u0, u1) # dataframe of random effects\n\n\n\n\nA.3.2 Level 1\nSimulating the Level 1 data is more complex.\nWe uncount the data by 100 to create 100 observations for each country. We then create an id number.\nWe create randomly simulated parental discipline variables with proportions similar to those in MICS.\nLastly, we need to create the dependent variable. Because this is a dichotomous outcome, the process is somewhat complex. We need to craete a linear combination z, using regression weights derived from MICS. We then calculate predicted probabilities, and lastly generate a dichotomous aggression outcome from those probabilities.\n\n\nShow the code\nMICSsimulated <- randomeffects %>% \n  uncount(N) %>% # N individuals / country\n  mutate(id = row_number()) %>% # unique id\n  mutate(cd1 = rbinom(N * N_countries, 1, .38), # spank\n         cd2 = rbinom(N * N_countries, 1, .05), # beat\n         cd3 = rbinom(N * N_countries, 1, .64), # shout\n         cd4 = rbinom(N * N_countries, 1, .78)) %>% # explain\n  mutate(z = .7 + # linear combination based on MICS\n           .23 * cd1 +\n           .52 * cd2 +\n           .42 * cd3 +\n           -.21 * cd4 + \n           u0) %>%\n  mutate(p = exp(z) / (1 + exp(z))) %>% # probability\n  mutate(aggression = rbinom(N * N_countries, 1, p)) %>% # binomial y\n  select(id, country, \n         cd1, cd2, cd3, cd4, \n         aggression)\n\n\n\n\nA.3.3 Variable Labels\nWe add variable labels to the data which will help us to understand the data as we analyze it.\n\n\nShow the code\nvar_label(MICSsimulated$id) <- \"id\"\n\nvar_label(MICSsimulated$country) <- \"country\"\n\nvar_label(MICSsimulated$cd1) <- \"spank\"\n\nvar_label(MICSsimulated$cd2) <- \"beat\"\n\nvar_label(MICSsimulated$cd3) <- \"shout\"\n\nvar_label(MICSsimulated$cd4) <- \"explain\"\n\nvar_label(MICSsimulated$aggression) <- \"aggression\""
