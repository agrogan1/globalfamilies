    "text": "1.1 Introduction\nGender inequality perpetuates harmful norms that justify violence against women and children and is associated with higher rates of family violence.\nWorldwide, parental physical abuse is a common form of family violence that children are exposed to at alarming rates. Parental engagement in physical abuse is linked to negative child outcomes including depression, anxiety, and aggression that may persist into adulthood. Globally, these continuing mental health and aggression problems may have high financial costs, with effects both on social service systems and developing economies.\nDespite the substantial scholarship on parent- and family-level predictors of parent-to-child physical violence, important questions remain about societal-level predictors of parental physical abuse and its associations with young children’s development in developing and transitional countries.\nA further gap in prior literature is the lack of studies that have examined potential moderators such as child age and household economic status in the associations between gender inequality and parental violence against children.\nUsing data from over 520,000 families in 57 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the current project seeks to address these research gaps by examining the associations of country-level gender inequality and violent social contexts with caregivers’ use of physically abusive behavior and child social-emotional development. We will employ multilevel models using data on parental physical violence against children, family socio-economic characteristics, and children’s social-emotional development from the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) and data on country-level gender inequality and violent social contexts from the United Nations Development Programme on Human Development and the World Health Organization Global Health Observatory.",

    "text": "Julie Ma, Principal Investigator\nAssociate Professor of Social Work and Director, Department of Social Work, College of Health Sciences, The University of Michigan-Flint\nProfessor Ma’s research interests center around the effects of parental physical violence and cultural norms that endorse such violence on the well-being of children, both at local and global levels. Her ongoing research projects primarily focus on examining the link between parental physical abuse and the social-emotional development of young children. She specifically focuses on exploring these associations within the context of gender inequality and violent norms and crimes in low- and middle-income countries.\nAndy Grogan-Kaylor, Co-Investigator\nSandra K. Danziger Collegiate Professor, Professor of Social Work, University of Michigan School of Social Work\nProfessor Grogan-Kaylor’s research focuses on basic and intervention research on children and families with the aim of reducing violence against children and improving family and child wellbeing. Grogan-Kaylor’s current research projects examine parenting behaviors such as physical punishment and parental expressions of emotional warmth and support, and their effects on children’s aggression, antisocial behavior, anxiety, and depression.\nShawna Lee, Co-Investigator\nProfessor of Social Work, University of Michigan School of Social Work\nProfessor Lee is a professor at the University of Michigan School of Social Work. She is the director of the Parenting in Context Research Lab and the director of the Program Evaluation Group at the School. Lee has published on topics related to child maltreatment, fathers’ parenting, father-child relationships, parenting stress and family functioning, and parental discipline. Her recent research focuses on parenting and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDana Charles McCoy, Consultant\nMarie and Max Kargman Associate Professor in Human Development and Urban Education Advancement, the Harvard Graduate School of Education\nProfessor McCoy’s work focuses on understanding the ways that poverty and violence in children’s home, school, and neighborhood environments affect the development of their cognitive and socioemotional skills in early childhood. She is also interested in the development, refinement, and evaluation of early intervention programs designed to promote positive development and resilience in young children, particularly in terms of their self-regulation and executive function.\nElizabeth Heger Boyle, Consultant\nProfessor of Sociology & Law, University of Minnesota\nProfessor Boyle studies women’s and children’s right to health, with a focus on the negative impacts of violence. She is committed to making comparative health microdata more accessible to researchers around the world; to that end, she is Principal Investigator of IPUMS Global Health, a set of online tools with free harmonized health and well-being data from the DHS Program, UNICEF, and Performance Monitoring for Action. Professor Boyle’s recent research focuses on orphans’ experience with violent discipline in sub-Saharan Africa and the relationship between women and children’s health and armed conflict.\nKaitlin P. Ward, Consultant\nResearch Affiliate, University of Michigan; People Analytics Researcher, Google\nKaitlin’s research focuses on unveiling the ecological predictors of child development among impoverished populations in the US and families living in low- and middle-income countries abroad. She focuses on how broader contextual factors such as neighborhood/community, country, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and gender inequality impact the functioning of the family unit, and in turn, how family processes impact child outcomes. She also serves as the primary methodologist on international program evaluations and randomized controlled trials where she tests the efficacy of culturally informed interventions on child and family health outcomes.\nOlivia Chang, Research Assistant\nOlivia D. Chang is a PhD student in the Joint Social Work and Developmental Psychology doctoral program at the University of Michigan.

Section 6.3.2.1\nAdd variable labels (if we can). Section 6.3.2.2\nAdd value labels (if we can). Section 6.3.2.3\nRecode outliers, values that are errors, or values that should be coded as missing Section 6.3.2.4\n\n\nMuch of R’s functionality is accomplished through writing code, that is saved in a script. Notice how–as our tasks get more and more complicated–the saved script provides documentation for the decisions that we have made with the data. A sample R script for the steps found in this chapter can be found in Appendix A.\n\n\n6.3.2.1 Only keep the variables of interest.\n\nWe can easily accomplish this with the subset function\n\n\nmynewdata &lt;- subset(MICSsimulated,\n                    select = c(id, country, aggression)) # subset of data\n\n\nhead(mynewdata) # look at top (head) of data\n\n  id country aggression\n1  1       1          1\n2  2       1          1\n3  3       1          1\n4  4       1          1\n5  5       1          0\n6  6       1          1\n\n\n\n\n6.3.2.2 Add variable labels (if we can).\n\nAdding variable labels is still somewhat new in R. The labelled library allows us to add or change variable labels. However, not every library in R recognizes variable labels.\n\n\nlibrary(labelled) # variable labels\n\nvar_label(MICSsimulated$id) &lt;- \"id\"\n\nvar_label(MICSsimulated$country) &lt;- \"country\"\n\nvar_label(MICSsimulated$cd4) &lt;- \"explain\"\n\n\n\n6.3.2.3 Add value labels (if we can).\n\nIn contrast, value labels are straightforward in R, and can be accomplished by creating a factor variable. Below we demonstrate how to do this with the happy variable.\n\n\nMICSsimulated$cd4 &lt;- factor(MICSsimulated$cd4,\n                             levels = c(0, 1),\n                             labels = c(\"Did not explain\",\n                                        \"Explained\"))\n\n\nhead(MICSsimulated) # head (top) of data\n\n  id country GII HDI cd1 cd2 cd3             cd4 aggression\n1  1       1  20  24   0   0   1       Explained          1\n2  2       1  20  24   0   0   1       Explained          1\n3  3       1  20  24   0   0   1       Explained          1\n4  4       1  20  24   0   0   0 Did not explain          1\n5  5       1  20  24   1   0   1       Explained          0\n6  6       1  20  24   0   0   1       Explained          1\n\n\n\n\n6.3.2.4 Recode outliers, values that are errors, or values that should be coded as missing.\n\nWe can easily accomplish this using Base R’s syntax for recoding: data$variable[rule] &lt;- newvalue.\n\n\nMICSsimulated$aggression[MICSsimulated$aggression &gt; 1] &lt;- NA # recode &gt; 1 to NA\n\nMICSsimulated$GII[MICSsimulated$GII &gt; 100] &lt;- NA # recode &gt; 100 to NA\n\n\nhead(MICSsimulated) # head (top) of data\n\n  id country GII HDI cd1 cd2 cd3             cd4 aggression\n1  1       1  20  24   0   0   1       Explained          1\n2  2       1  20  24   0   0   1       Explained          1\n3  3       1  20  24   0   0   1       Explained          1\n4  4       1  20  24   0   0   0 Did not explain          1\n5  5       1  20  24   1   0   1       Explained          0\n6  6       1  20  24   0   0   1       Explained          1\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3.3 Simple Analysis\nOur first step in analysis is to discover what kind of variables we have. We need to make a distinction between continuous variables that measure things like mental health or neighborhood safety, or age, and categorical variables that measure non-ordered categories like religious identity or gender identity.\n\nSometimes deciding whether a variable is continuous or categorical involves some hard thinking, or referring to the documentation for the data. In this data, all of the forms of discipline, as well as aggression are 1/0 variables, so likely best conceptualized as categorical variables. In contrast, GII and HDI are best conceptualized as continuous variables.\n\n\nFor continuous variables, it is most appropriate to take the average or mean.\nFor categorical variables, it is most appropriate to generate a frequency table.\n\n\nAs a mostly command based language, R relies on the idea of do_something(dataset$variable).\n\n\nsummary(MICSsimulated$GII) # descriptive statistics for GII\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Random effects are discussed in the above references, but essentially represent country level differences in the data.\nWe also create GII, a Gender Inequality Index (United Nations Development Program, 2023) variable, and HDI, a measure of the Human Development Index (United Nations Development Program, 2022), since these are country level, or Level 2 variables.\n\n\nShow the code\ncountry &lt;- seq(1:N_countries) # sequence 1 to 30\n\nGII &lt;- rbinom(N_countries, 100, .25) # gender inequality index\n\nHDI &lt;- rbinom(N_countries, 100, .25) # Human Development Index\n\nu0 &lt;- rnorm(N_countries, 0, .25) # random intercept\n\nu1 &lt;- rnorm(N_countries, 0, .05) # random slope\n\nrandomeffects &lt;- data.frame(country, \n                            GII, \n                            HDI, \n                            u0, \n                            u1) # dataframe of random effects\n\n\n\n\nB.3.2 Level 1\nSimulating the Level 1 data is more complex.\nWe uncount the data by 100 to create 100 observations for each country. We then create an id number.\nWe create randomly simulated parental discipline variables with proportions similar to those in MICS.\nLastly, we need to create the dependent variable. Because this is a dichotomous outcome, the process is somewhat complex. We need to craete a linear combination z, using regression weights derived from MICS. We then calculate predicted probabilities, and lastly generate a dichotomous aggression outcome from those probabilities.\n\n\nShow the code\nMICSsimulated &lt;- randomeffects %&gt;% \n  uncount(N) %&gt;% # N individuals / country\n  mutate(id = row_number()) %&gt;% # unique id\n  mutate(cd1 = rbinom(N * N_countries, 1, .38), # spank\n         cd2 = rbinom(N * N_countries, 1, .05), # beat\n         cd3 = rbinom(N * N_countries, 1, .64), # shout\n         cd4 = rbinom(N * N_countries, 1, .78)) %&gt;% # explain\n  mutate(z = 0 + # linear combination based on MICS\n           .01 * GII +\n           .23 * cd1 +\n           .52 * cd2 +\n           .42 * cd3 +\n           -.21 * cd4 + \n           u0) %&gt;%\n  mutate(p = exp(z) / (1 + exp(z))) %&gt;% # probability\n  mutate(aggression = rbinom(N * N_countries, 1, p)) %&gt;% # binomial y\n  select(id, country, GII, HDI,\n         cd1, cd2, cd3, cd4, \n         aggression)\n\n\n\n\nB.3.3 Variable Labels\nWe add variable labels to the data which will help us to understand the data as we analyze it.\n\n\nShow the code\nvar_label(MICSsimulated$id) &lt;- \"id\"\n\nvar_label(MICSsimulated$country) &lt;- \"country\"\n\nvar_label(MICSsimulated$GII) &lt;- \"Gender Inequality Index\"\n\nvar_label(MICSsimulated$HDI) &lt;- \"Human Development Index\"\n\nvar_label(MICSsimulated$cd1) &lt;- \"spank\"\n\nvar_label(MICSsimulated$cd2) &lt;- \"beat\"\n\nvar_label(MICSsimulated$cd3) &lt;- \"shout\"\n\nvar_label(MICSsimulated$cd4) &lt;- \"explain\"\n\nvar_label(MICSsimulated$aggression) &lt;- \"aggression\"\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\npander(labelled::look_for(MICSsimulated)[1:4]) # list out variable labels\n\n\n\n\nTable B.1: Variable Labels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npos\nvariable\nlabel\ncol_type\n\n\n\n\n1\nid\nid\nint\n\n\n2\ncountry\ncountry\nint\n\n\n3\nGII\nGender Inequality Index\nint\n\n\n4\nHDI\nHuman Development Index\nint\n\n\n5\ncd1\nspank\nint\n\n\n6\ncd2\nbeat\nint\n\n\n7\ncd3\nshout\nint\n\n\n8\ncd4\nexplain\nint\n\n\n9\naggression\naggression\nint",
