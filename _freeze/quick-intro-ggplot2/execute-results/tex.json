A reference to the data you are using.\n2. An *aesthetic* that tells `ggplot` which variables are being mapped to the *x axis*, *y axis*, (and often other attributes of the graph, such as the *color*, * color fill*, or even the *shape*, *size*, *transparency*, or *line type*).  Intuitively, the aesthetic can be thought of as **what you are graphing**.\n3. A *geom* or *geometry* that tells ggplot about the basic structure of the graph.  Intuitively, the geom can be thought of as **how you are graphing it**.\n\nYou can also add other options, such as a *graph title*, *axis labels* and *overall theme* for the graph.\n\n## Get Started\n\n### Call Libraries\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2) # beautiful graphs\n\nlibrary(ggthemes) # nice themes for ggplot2\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Get Data\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nload(\"./simulate-data/MICSsimulated.RData\") # data in R format\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Some Examples[^vartype]\n\n### One Continuous Variable\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# anything that starts with a '#' is a comment\n\nggplot(MICSsimulated, # the data I am using\n       aes(x = GII)) + # the variable I am using\n  geom_histogram() # how I am graphing it\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histogram of Gender Inequality Index](quick-intro-ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/fig-ggplot-histogram-1.pdf){#fig-ggplot-histogram fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n[^vartype]: Changing variables from factor to numeric (e.g. `aes(x = as.numeric(outcome))`), and *vice versa* can sometimes be a simple solution that solves a lot of problems when you are trying to graph your variables.\n\nWe can add color and a theme.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# anything that starts with a '#' is a comment\n\nggplot(MICSsimulated, # the data I am using\n       aes(x = GII)) + # the variable I am using\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"#1CABE2\") + # how I am graphing it\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histogram of Gender Inequality Index With Better Options](quick-intro-ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/fig-ggplot-histogram-color-1.pdf){#fig-ggplot-histogram-color fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### One Categorical Variable\n\nMake sure R knows `aggression` is a categorical variable.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nMICSsimulated$aggression <- \n  factor(MICSsimulated$aggression, # original numeric variable\n         levels = c(0, 1), \n         labels = c(\"no aggression\", \"aggression\"), \n         ordered = TRUE) # whether order matters\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow make the graph.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(MICSsimulated, # the data I am using\n       aes(x = aggression)) + # the variable I am using\n  geom_bar() # how I am graphing it\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bar Graph of Aggression](quick-intro-ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/fig-ggplot-bar-1.pdf){#fig-ggplot-bar fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can add color and a theme.[^legend]\n\n[^legend]: Notice how use of `fill` governs both the color fill in the graph below, as well as the legend that is produced in the graph. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(MICSsimulated, # the data I am using\n       aes(x = aggression, # x is aggression\n           fill = aggression)) + # fill is also aggression\n  geom_bar() + # how I am graphing it\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bar Graph of Aggression With Better Options](quick-intro-ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/fig-ggplot-bar-color-1.pdf){#fig-ggplot-bar-color fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Make a More Complex Graph[^legend2]\n\n[^legend2]: Notice how use of `fill` governs both the color fill in the graph below, as well as the legend that is produced in the graph. \n\nMake sure R knows `cd1` is a categorical variable.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nMICSsimulated$cd1 <- \n  factor(MICSsimulated$cd1, # original numeric variable\n         levels = c(0, 1), \n         labels = c(\"no spank\", \"spank\"), \n         ordered = TRUE) # whether order matters\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow make the graph.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(MICSsimulated, # the data I am using\n       aes(x = cd1, # x is spanking\n           fill = aggression)) + # fill is aggression\n  geom_bar(position = position_dodge()) + # graph with \"dodged\" bars\n  labs(title = \"Spanking and Aggression\", \n       x = \"spanking\", \n       y = \"count\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1CABE2\", # UNICEF colors\n                               \"#D8D1C9\")) +\n  theme_minimal()  # theme\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](quick-intro-ggplot2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-8-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAn interactive tutorial to create this plot can be found [here](https://agrogan1.github.io/globalfamilies-flipbook/).\n\n[^moreinformation]: More information can be found here:  https://agrogan1.github.io/R/introduction-to-ggplot2/introduction-to-ggplot2.html\n\n\n",
