**Julie Ma, Principal Investigator**

Associate Professor of Social Work, UM-Flint

Professor Maâ€™s research interests center around the effects of parental physical violence and cultural norms that endorse such violence on the well-being of children, both at local and global levels. Her ongoing research projects primarily focus on examining the link between parental physical abuse and the social-emotional development of young children. She specifically focuses on exploring these associations within the context of gender inequality and violent norms and crimes in low- and middle-income countries.
