**Julie Ma, Principal Investigator**

Associate Professor of Social Work and Director, Department of Social Work, College of Health Sciences, The University of Michigan-Flint

Professor Ma’s research interests center around the effects of parental physical violence and cultural norms that endorse such violence on the well-being of children, both at local and global levels. Her ongoing research projects primarily focus on examining the link between parental physical abuse and the social-emotional development of young children. She specifically focuses on exploring these associations within the context of gender inequality and violent norms and crimes in low- and middle-income countries.

**Kaitlin P. Ward, Consultant** 

Research Affiliate, University of Michigan; People Analytics Researcher, Google

Kaitlin's research focuses on unveiling the ecological predictors of child development among impoverished populations in the US and families living in low- and middle-income countries abroad. She focuses on how broader contextual factors such as neighborhood/community, country, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and gender inequality impact the functioning of the family unit, and in turn, how family processes impact child outcomes. She also serves as the primary methodologist on international program evaluations and randomized controlled trials where she tests the efficacy of culturally informed interventions on child and family health outcomes.
